# Using TraefikConsulProxy

:::{warning}
While it works today (2023), there does not appear to be a maintained Python client for the consul API.
As such, using jupyterhub-traefik-proxy with consul is deprecated in jupyterhub-traefik-proxy 1.0.
You can use redis instead to achieve the same functionality (and slightly better performance).
:::

[Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
is a distributed key-value store.
This and TraefikEtcdProxy is the choice to use when using jupyterhub-traefik-proxy
in a distributed setup, such as a Kubernetes cluster,
e.g. with multiple traefik-proxy instances.

## How-To install TraefikConsulProxy

1. Install **jupyterhub**
2. Install **jupyterhub-traefik-proxy**
3. Install **traefik**
4. Install **consul**

- You can find the full installation guide and examples in the [installation section](install)

## How-To enable TraefikConsulProxy

You can enable JupyterHub to work with `TraefikConsulProxy` in jupyterhub_config.py,
using the `proxy_class` configuration option.

You can choose to:

- use the `traefik_consul` entrypoint, new in JupyterHub 1.0, e.g.:

  ```python
  c.JupyterHub.proxy_class = "traefik_consul"
  ```

- use the TraefikConsulProxy object, in which case, you have to import the module, e.g.:

  ```python
  from jupyterhub_traefik_proxy import TraefikConsulProxy
  c.JupyterHub.proxy_class = TraefikConsulProxy
  ```

## Consul configuration

1. Depending on the value of the `should_start` proxy flag, you can choose whether or not TraefikConsulProxy willl be externally managed.
   - When **should_start** is set to **True**, TraefikConsulProxy will auto-generate its static configuration
     (using the override values or the defaults) and store it in `traefik.toml` file.
     The traefik process will then be launched using this file.
   - When **should_start** is set to **False**, prior to starting the traefik process, you must create a _toml_ file with the desired
     traefik static configuration and pass it to traefik. Keep in mind that in order for the routes to be stored in **consul**,
     this _toml_ file **must** specify consul as the provider.

2. TraefikConsulProxy searches in the consul key-value store the keys starting with the **kv_traefik_prefix** prefix in order to build its static configuration.

   Similarly, the dynamic configuration is built by searching the **kv_jupyterhub_prefix**.

   ```{note}
    If you want to change or add traefik's static configuration options, you can add them to consul under this prefix and traefik will pick them up.
   ```

   - The **default** values of this configurations options are:

     ```
     kv_traefik_prefix = "traefik/"
     kv_jupyterhub_prefix = "jupyterhub/"
     ```

   - You can **override** the default values of the prefixes by passing their desired values through `jupyterhub_config.py` e.g.:
     ```
     c.TraefikConsulProxy.kv_traefik_prefix="some_static_config_prefix/"
     c.TraefikConsulProxy.kv_jupyterhub_prefix="some_dynamic_config_prefix/"
     ```

3. By **default**, TraefikConsulProxy assumes consul accepts client requests on the official **default** consul port `8500` for client requests.

   ```python
   c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8500"
   ```

   If the consul cluster is deployed differently than using the consul defaults, then you **must** pass the consul url to the proxy using
   the `consul_url` option in _jupyterhub_config.py_:

   ```python
   c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_url = "scheme://hostname:port"
   ```

   ````{note}
   **TraefikConsulProxy does not manage the consul cluster** and assumes it is up and running before the proxy itself starts.
   However, based on how consul is configured and started, TraefikConsulProxy needs to be told about
   some consul configuration details, such as:
     * consul **address** where it accepts client requests
       ```python
       c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_url = "scheme://hostname:port"
       ```
     * consul **credentials** (if consul has acl enabled)
       ```python
         c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_password = "123"
       ```

   Checkout the [consul documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/)
   to find out more about possible consul configuration options.

## Externally managed TraefikConsulProxy

If TraefikConsulProxy is used as an externally managed service, then make sure you follow the steps enumerated below:

1.  Let JupyterHub know that the proxy being used is TraefikConsulProxy, using the _proxy_class_ configuration option:

    ```python
    c.JupyterHub.proxy_class = "traefik_consul"
    ```

2.  Configure `TraefikConsulProxy` in **jupyterhub_config.py**

    JupyterHub configuration file, _jupyterhub_config.py_ must specify at least:
    - That the proxy is externally managed
    - The traefik api credentials
    - The consul credentials (if consul acl is enabled)

    Example configuration:

    ```python
    # JupyterHub shouldn't start the proxy, it's already running
    c.TraefikConsulProxy.should_start = False

    # if not the default:
    c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_url = "http://consul-host:2379"

    # traefik api credentials
    c.TraefikConsulProxy.traefik_api_username = "abc"
    c.TraefikConsulProxy.traefik_api_password = "123"

    # consul acl token
    c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_password = "456"
    ```

3.  Create a _toml_ file with traefik's desired static configuration

    Before starting the traefik process, you must create a _toml_ file with the desired
    traefik static configuration and pass it to traefik when you launch the process.
    Keep in mind that in order for the routes to be stored in **consul**,
    this _toml_ file **must** specify consul as the provider/
    - **Keep in mind that the static configuration must configure at least:**
      - The default entrypoint
      - The api entrypoint
      - The consul provider

    Example:

    ```toml
    # enable the api
    [api]

    # the public port where traefik accepts http requests
    [entryPoints.http]
    address = ":8000"

    # the port on localhost where the traefik api should be found
    [entryPoints.auth_api]
    address = "localhost:8099"

    [providers.consul]
    # the consul username (if auth is enabled)
    username = "def"
    # the consul password (if auth is enabled)
    password = "456"
    # the consul address
    endpoints = ["127.0.0.1:8500"]
    # the prefix to use for the static configuration
    rootKey = "traefik"
    ```

    ````{note}
    If you choose to enable consul Access Control Lists (ACLs) to secure the UI, API, CLI, service communications, and agent communications, you can use this *toml* file to pass the credentials to traefik, e.g.:

    ```toml
    [providers.consul]
    password = "admin"
    ...
    ```

    ````

## Example setup

This is an example setup for using JupyterHub and TraefikConsulProxy managed by another service than JupyterHub.

1. Configure the proxy through the JupyterHub configuration file, _jupyterhub_config.py_, e.g.:

   ```python
   # mark the proxy as externally managed
   c.TraefikConsulProxy.should_start = False

   # traefik api endpoint login password
   c.TraefikConsulProxy.traefik_api_password = "abc"

   # traefik api endpoint login username
   c.TraefikConsulProxy.traefik_api_username = "123"

   # consul url where it accepts client requests
   c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8500"

   # configure JupyterHub to use TraefikConsulProxy
   c.JupyterHub.proxy_class = "traefik_consul"
   ```

   ```{note}
   If you intend to enable consul acl, add the acl token to *jupyterhub_config.py* under *consul_password*:

       # consul token
       c.TraefikConsulProxy.consul_password = "456"
   ```

2. Starts the agent in development mode on the default port on localhost. e.g.:

   ```bash
   $ consul agent -dev
   ```

   ```{note}
    If you intend to enable consul acl, checkout [this guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/security-networking/production-acls).
   ```

3. Create a traefik static configuration file, _traefik.toml_, e.g:.

   ```toml
   # enable the api
   [api]

   # the public port where traefik accepts http requests
   [entryPoints.http]
   address = ":8000"

   # the port on localhost where the traefik api should be found
   [entryPoints.auth_api]
   address = "localhost:8099"

   [providers.consul]
   # the username (if auth is enabled)
   username = "def"
   # the password (if auth is enabled)
   password = "456"
   # the consul address
   endpoints = ["127.0.0.1:8500"]
   # the prefix to use for the static configuration
   rootKey = "traefik"
   ```

4. Start traefik with the configuration specified above, e.g.:
   ```bash
   $ traefik -c traefik.toml
   ```
